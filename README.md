## ℹ️ Overview

This is my NPC generator that I made as a faster and more efficient solution to this problem. It functions by first inputting the amount of NPCs that you want to generate. Then you input the name and gender of the NPC and get the rest of the attributes given to you. It will output the height, hostility, name, gender, profession, and personality of the NPC. While doing this, it will play a scrambling animation that cycles through the random possibilities before giving you the attributes. This creates a unique generation experience. I am Aarush Singh and I made it so that people could quickly generate NPCs that are diverse and unique. Having to make lots of NPCs by hand and have them all be unique can be difficult for game development and this provides an effective solution.
 
### ✍️ Author

I am Aarush Singh, a student of the CSAEA. I made this program to solve the problem of having to tediously hand craft each NPC for video game development. This program brings automation to NPC generation, giving people the opportunity to easily generate interesting NPCs with the click of a button. This project was also a way for me to practice basic python skills like loops, conditionals, and variables.
